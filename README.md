# gitops-k8s

This document aim to provide an opinionated working solutions leveraging Kubernetes and proven GitOps techniques to have a resilient and scalable architecture and allow developers to spend more time on actual business problems rather boring and error prone infrastructure issues.

Nothing of what is outlined below is new or innovative, but it should be at least a good starting point to have a cluster up and running pretty quickly and give you a chance to remain focused and try out new ideas.

Feedback and helps are always welcome!

## Introduction

### TL;DR

* Kubernetes is a declarative system
* Git can be used to describe infrastructure and applications
* GitOps is a way to do Continuous Delivery and operate Kubernetes via Git pull requests
* GitOps empowers developers to do operations
* CI pipelines should only run builds, tests and publish images
* In a pull-based approach, an operator deploys new images from inside of the cluster
* You can only observe the actual state of the cluster and react when it diverge from the desiderd one

### Imperative vs Declarative

In an *imperative* system, the user knows the desired state, determines the sequence of commands to transition the system to the desired state and supplies a representation of the commands to the system.

By contrast, in a *declarative* system, the user knows the desired state, supplies a representation of the desired state to the system, then the system reads the current state and determines the sequence of commands to transition the system to the desired state.

Declarative systems have the distinct advantage of being able to react to unintended state changes without further supervision. In the event of an unintended state change leading to a state drift, the system may autonomously determine and apply the set of mitigating actions leading to a state match. This process is called a **control loop**, a popular choice for the implementation of controllers.

### What is GitOps?

GitOps is the art and science of using Git pull requests to manage infrastructure provisioning and software deployment.

The concept of GitOps originated at Weaveworks, whose developers described how they use Git to create a **single source of truth**. Kubernetes is a **declarative** system and by using declarative tools, the entire set of configuration files can be version controlled in Git.

More generally, GitOps is a way to do Continuous Delivery and operate Kubernetes via Git.

### Push vs Pull

In a *push*-based pipeline, the CI system runs build and tests, followed by a deployment directly to Kubernetes. This is an *anti-pattern*. CI server is not an orchestration tool. You need something that continually attempts to make progress until there are no more diffs because CI fails when it encounters a difference and then you could end up being in a partial and unknown state.

In a *pull*-based pipeline, a Kubernetes **operator** deploys new images from inside of the cluster. The operator notices when a new image has been pushed to the registry. Convergence of the cluster state is then triggered and the new image is pulled from the registry, the manifest is automatically updated and the new image is deployed to the cluster.

A CI pipeline should be used to merge and integrate updates with master, while with GitOps you should rely on Kubernetes or the cluster to internally manage deployments based on those master updates.

You could potentially have multiple cluster pointing to the same GitOps repo, but you won't have a centralized view of them, all the clusters will be independent.

### Observability

Git provides a source of truth for the desired state of the system and *observability* provides a source of truth for the actual state of the running system.

You cannot say what actual state is in the cluster. You can only observe it. This is why diffs are so important.

A system is observable if developers can understand its current state from the outside. Observability is a property of systems like Availability and Scalability. Monitoring, Tracing and Logging are techniques for baseline observations.

Observability is a source of truth for the actual running state of the system right now. You observe the running system in order to understand and control it. Observed state must be compared with the desired state in Git and usually you want to monitor and alert when the system diverge from the desired state.

## Argo CD

> Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes

This guide will explain how to setup in few steps the whole infrastructure on DigitalOcean using GitOps and Argo CD. Note that it's not tightly coupled to any specific vendor and you should be able to easily port it on [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks) or [GKE](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) for example.

Most of the steps have been kept manual on purpose, but they should be automated in a production enviroment.

TODO Split local vs Cloud

TODO Makefile

```bash
cd bootstrap/

helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
helm dependency update

# bootstrap
# 1) install argocd
# 2) create application of applications
# --namespace argocd overrides .Release.Namespace
# fix is part of a different application: release-name

```

### Prerequisites

* Create a Kubernetes cluster on [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/kubernetes)
    * $10/month for Worker Node
    * $10/month for Load Balancer
* Setup [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) to run commands against Kubernetes clusters
    ```bash
    # ubuntu
    sudo snap install kubectl --classic
    # macOS
    brew install kubernetes-cli
    ```
* Setup [helm](https://helm.sh/docs/using_helm/#installing-helm) for templating purposes only
    ```bash
    # ubuntu
    sudo snap install helm --classic
    # macOS
    brew install kubernetes-helm
    ```
* Before continue you should download cluster configs and test the connection
    ```bash
    export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/CLUSTER_NAME-kubeconfig.yaml
    kubectl get nodes
    ```

### How it works?

Argo CD automates the deployment of the desired application states in the specified target environments. In this project Kubernetes manifests are specified as [helm](https://helm.sh/docs) charts.

TODO improve

You need to embrace failures if you want to have the ability to heal and recover automatically in most of the situations. A useful pattern is to have an `initContainer` to solve dependencies between various resources. For example a Kafka application should check if topics have been properly created (ideally by an operator) before even start.

### Bootstrap

![bootstrap](docs/img/bootstrap.png)

[Here](charts/argocd) you can find the [official](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/blob/master/manifests/install.yaml) installation packaged as Helm chart.

1. TODO secrets for private charts
2. Setup Argo CD
    ```bash
    # apply chart
    helm template -f charts/argocd/values.yaml charts/argocd/ | kubectl apply -n argocd -f -

    # open https://localhost:8080
    kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
    # username: admin
    # password: (autogenerated) the pod name of the Argo CD API server
    kubectl get pods -n argocd -l app.kubernetes.io/name=argocd-server -o name | cut -d'/' -f 2
    ```
3. Setup Argo CD application of applications
    ```bash
    helm repo add argo https://argoproj.github.io/argo-helm
    # apply chart
    helm template -f bootstrap/values.yaml bootstrap/ | kubectl apply -n argocd -f -

    # open https://localhost:8081
    kubectl port-forward service/guestbook-ui -n guestbook 8081:80
    ```
4. First time only you have to sync manually all the `OutOfSync` applications

This is how it should looks like on the UI

TODO

* >>> setup `LoadBalancer`
* bootstrap chart
* how to add an `Application`/`AppProject`/`ConfigMap` (secrets) and conventions
* [docs](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup)
* login with GitHub
* how to sync automatically first time
* [AppProject](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/project.yaml) template
* `Application` deployments can track updates to branches, tags, or pinned to a specific version of manifests at a Git commit.
